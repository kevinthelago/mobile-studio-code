// VENDORED from base-studio-code src/shared/ui/spec/generalNode.ts @ ec59b972 (develop) — byte-exact
// except the manifest import path ("../manifest" -> "./manifest"). Update in LOCKSTEP; do not edit locally.

// The node — `{ type, props, children, binds, actions }` over the full primitive registry (#3485,
// #3496, #3500; the keystone is #3484).
//
// This REPLACED a closed `KitNode` union of 8 hardcoded kinds (card/header/field/button/row/toggle/
// tag/text) that could address only 8 of the ~67 primitives in the manifest, each with its own
// hand-written branch in the renderer. #3500 deleted that vocabulary outright: a node now names a real
// component, so the authorable surface IS the kit.
//
// THE VOCABULARY IS DERIVED, NOT DECLARED. Both the set of valid `type`s and the per-type prop rules
// come from `UI_KIT` (`shared/ui/manifest.ts`), so adding a primitive there makes it authorable here
// with no edit to this file. A hand-maintained mirror would drift, and a contract that drifts from the
// code is worse than no contract — agents author against it.
