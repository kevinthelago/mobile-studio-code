// Barycenter layer ordering (#2418, graph-core epic #2214) — the ONE crossing-reduction sweep the
// layered graphs share. Given a layer assignment (from `layerDag` or any layerer), order the nodes
// WITHIN each layer so each sits near the mean in-layer index of its neighbors — the classic Sugiyama
// barycenter heuristic. What VARIES per graph is tunable: the neighbor gathering (org pulls only from
// cross-layer hierarchy parents/children; Glance from every edge endpoint), the pass count, and the
// sweep discipline. Pure; the caller owns the layer→pixel placement.

   *   • "snapshot" — every layer sorts against the order at the START of the pass (Glance's). */

 * The initial order is `nodeIds` order filtered per layer; ties keep the pre-sort order (stable sort).
 *
 * @param nodeIds Every node, in the initial (seed) order.
 * @param layerOf The layer assignment (e.g. `layerDag`'s).
 * @param neighborsOf The ids whose in-layer positions pull on a node — the caller's neighbor
 *   gathering. Multiplicity counts (a doubly-connected neighbor pulls twice); ids outside `nodeIds`
 *   are ignored.
 * @returns layer → its node ids in final order (layers in ascending order).
