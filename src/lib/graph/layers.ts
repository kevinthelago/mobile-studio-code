// VENDORED from base-studio-code src/shared/lib/graph/layers.ts @ 6349c0a2 (develop) — byte-exact
// except imports (unchanged here). Update in LOCKSTEP with the desktop copy (the noiseVectors.json
// precedent: vendored, drift-checked by eye/diff). Do not edit locally.
// Topological layering (#2214, graph-core epic) — the ONE longest-path layerer the graphs share. A
// dependency/coordination DAG flows across LAYERS: each node lands as deep as its longest incoming
// chain, so a source (no in-edges) sits at layer 0. The caller hands in a cycle-break set (the
// back-edges it already computed via `cycles.ts`, or its 2-cycle mutual pairs) so a loop can't diverge
// the layout. Pure; the callers own the layer→pixel PLACEMENT (Glance's grid, Relationship's swimlanes)
// — this only assigns the layer number.

/**
 * Longest-path topological layering. Assigns each node in `nodeIds` an integer layer so that for every
 * kept edge `from→to`, `layer[to] >= layer[from] + 1` — sources sit at layer 0 and each node lands as
 * deep as its longest incoming chain. Edges in `backEdgeIds` (the caller's cycle-break set), self-loops,
 * and edges touching an id outside `nodeIds` are ignored, so a cycle can't diverge the assignment. The
 * result is the DAG's unique longest-path layering, so it's independent of the relaxation order (and
 * identical to a Kahn / memoized-DFS layerer over the same acyclic edge set).
 *
 * Edge direction is "from → deeper": a node points to the nodes that must sit BELOW it. A "depends-on"
 * DAG — where the dependency should sit at a LOWER layer than its dependent — reverses its edges before
 * calling (see Glance's `buildGraph`).
