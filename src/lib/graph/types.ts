// VENDORED from base-studio-code src/shared/lib/graph/types.ts @ 6349c0a2 (develop) — byte-exact
// except imports (unchanged here). Update in LOCKSTEP with the desktop copy (the noiseVectors.json
// precedent: vendored, drift-checked by eye/diff). Do not edit locally.
// Shared graph core (#2214, epic) — the pure (React-free) graph primitives that Glance, the Org
// designer, and the agent-relationship graph all build on, so layering/cycle/focus logic lives once
// instead of being re-copied per domain (#2204: "layout is a function of the data structure"). The
// render layer is already shared (GraphCanvas + useGraphViewport, #2208); this is the model layer.
//
// Each feature extends these bases with its own domain fields (role/status/kind/hardness/…) and
// palettes — the core only knows ids + direction.
